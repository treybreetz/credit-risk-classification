1. Explain the purpose of this analysis:
    - I would say the purpose of this analysis is to create a model that can predict if people will pay back a lending service or not. This could help the services decide who they give loans to, which could help their company a lot.
  
2. Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
   
   - Accuracy score : The score was .9520 or 95.20%. Formula: (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Number of Predictions)
Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model across all classes. It's the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances. While accuracy is a straightforward metric, it may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets where one class significantly outnumbers the others.

   - Precision Score : The score was 92%. Formula: (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives)
Precision, also known as positive predictive value, measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model. It is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Precision is crucial in situations where the cost of false positives is high.

   - Recall Score : The score was 95%. Formula: (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negatives)
Recall represents the ability of the model to capture all the relevant instances of a class. It is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total actual positives. Recall is especially important in scenarios where missing positive instances is more costly than having false positives.

3. Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

  - I would for sure reccomend to use this model. The model had a 95% accuracy with predicting if a customer would repay the loan. That is very accurate in my opinion and can help the business make a lot of smart decisions. If they knew if the borrower was going to pay them back with 95% accuracy before they even give them the loan, then the lending company has a very high chance at being succesful.
